Techniques:
o AVL Tree self-balancing, insertion and deletion.
o Pre-order Traversal
o Right Rotation
o Left Rotation

Self-balancing AVL trees self-balances with each insertion and deletion. For anagrams, Hash Map is created is used and checked for sorted strings and corresponding count is increased for original string array.Max heap is checked if the right part of balanced Tree is empty,  that is when parent node is greater than child node. If right tree isn't empty, its not max heap .In-order traversal is used for printing  the trees.

Data Structures Used:
ArrayList (Strings), Array, HashMap(Anagram)  ,Class-Objects, For, While, Switch Loops

How to execute/run the program? : 
Execute the .java file.
1) Enter an Integer (1-8) from the menu and choose operation.
2) For option 1 & 3 , Enter size of array(type: Integer) to be entered in integer, and then Followed by “ Enter the array: “ , Enter each String(type: string)
3) For option 4, Enter the String to be deleted.(type: String)

Note: 
None of the input should be empty.
